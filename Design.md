# Clan Design Document

This is a basic design document to help outline the design of a new clan for Monster Train 2. The goal is to provide a structured approach to development and ensure a cohesive theme and mechanics.

## Themes

### Visual
- Describe the aesthetic style of the clan (e.g., dark and shadowy, fiery and destructive, nature-infused, mechanical and artificial).
The Visuals are to be based on the Train Stewards, Mechanical, Tech Priest, etc... There should be some pseudo-britishness.
- Identify key visual motifs (e.g., colors, shapes, effects).
Colors should be orange-brown, furnace-like.
Shapes should be pipe-like, built out of cutlery
Effects should be fiery, but mostly contained to mechanical
- Mention any influences or inspirations for the visual design.
inspirations  include: 'Brazil', 'Warhammer 40k', 'Steampunk', 'Anything Kubrick made' and 'Batman'

### Mechanical
- Define the core mechanical identity of the clam.
Spell-wise the clan will use powerful spells that use pyre-health, room-ticks, rooms, and equipment as resources to accomplish great affect; You should feel like you are constantly salvaging one thing for another, like a busy butler unmaking the house to make a cup of tea.
Creature-wise the clan should lean into resource-generating abilities on longer-cooldowns, 
- How does the clan play differently from existing clans?
- Synergies with existing game mechanics.

## Clan

### Champions
- Outline the clan's Champion(s) and their role in battle.
Two Champions:
Albert, the Mad Butler
Grug the debugger

Albert, the Mad Butler provides a strong power-basis
